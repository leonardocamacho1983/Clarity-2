# Prisma Files Backup

This directory contains backups of Prisma files before cleanup on `date +"%Y-%m-%d"`.

## Files Backed Up
- /home/project/prisma/schema.prisma
- /home/project/hello-prisma/prisma/schema.prisma

## Cleanup Analysis
After analyzing the project structure, the following issues were identified:

1. Duplicate schema definitions:
   - Main project has `/prisma/schema.prisma` (empty schema)
   - Subdirectory has `/hello-prisma/prisma/schema.prisma` (complete schema with User and Post models)

2. The main project schema appears to be a placeholder without any model definitions, while
   the hello-prisma directory contains a complete working schema with proper models.
